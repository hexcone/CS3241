# CS3241
This repo collates the assignments for NUS CS3241 Computer Graphics

## Lab 1: Doodles
2D drawing in OpenGL using primitives and basic transformation. Bonus features: Gradient background, transparency

## Lab 2: The World is round
2D drawing in OpenGL with additional components of animation and focus on rotation with respect to other elements. Bonus features: Fading/ glowing stars, elliptical orbits

## Lab 3: Let there be light
3D drawing by combining primitive surfaces and implementation of illumination and flat/ smooth shading.  Bonus features: Camera movement, color change of light source

## Lab 4: let's get twisted
2D implementation of bezier curves and objects along the curve. Bonus features: Repositioning of existing points, animation of objects to simulate movement

## Lab 5: To Infinity and beyond (Ray tracing)
Implmentation of a ray tracer on 4 primitive objects. Bonus features: Shadows, addition of cylinder object

## Exam
Selected solution for past year papers.  

Hi future juniors, here's some tips for exams
- Print out your MA1301 cheatsheet if you still have them. sqrt(3)/2 = cos30? You might need to know them.
- Print out your github repo lol, kent ridge homenoffice charge 0.035 per page
- Write down the bezier curve equation up to degree 4/5? and their derivatives, don't be a kuku and derive them on the spot
  
If you suck at math  
- The for-loop for drawing circles? Good time to figure out where is the start/ end point and their degree.
